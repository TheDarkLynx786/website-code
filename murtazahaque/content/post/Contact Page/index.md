Hello there! You've been reading a lot of content on this website, haven't you? Well you're a good listener. Or reader. Whichever, you get the point.

Now I'm going to open up the floor (or simply a new page) where you can send me whatever's on YOUR mind! (It's a contact page, I made a contact page. This is way more dramatic than it's supposed to be, but hey, it's a post, so I suppose there has to be some entertainment value.)

So now if you've got anything you want to say, feel free to shoot me a message! 

The form currently uses EmailJS, which is pretty basic in terms of a messenger service. I plan to switch to another one soon like Nodemailer where I can (or rather you can) send file attachments without purchasing a subscription. There was a plan to add a section like that, but that's the point where the idea halted. 

On a real note, try not to send anything hateful, and well, you know your digital ettiquette. I ain't your mom or anything. Also, even if you do send something weird in: first of all, bruh, second of all, I'm likely to laugh it off anyway :).
