I've added a new Music Section to my site! It features all of the tracks I have worked on. This post is about a month old from when I am actually writing this (August 2nd, 2024), and that's because it took some time to develop the music section into something I actually found suited my site. And it's live! Go check it out --> [Music Section!](https://thedarklynx786.github.io/music/) (Or you know, you can just click the tab in the sidebar).

It took quite some time to get lists working, so I eventually just defauted to using tile lists and making my own custom ones from the site's theme. It worked really well! Gave me lot's of CSS experience while I was at it. Future plans for the site do include using JavaScript to make more interactive elements. Let's make this site more interesting, eh?
