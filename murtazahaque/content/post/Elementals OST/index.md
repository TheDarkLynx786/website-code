Call me the Iron Chef of BeepBox, cus I'm COOKING!!

I got involved in the creation of my first game soundtrack for a group of people. They seemed to like it quite a lot, and I certainly hope you all do to! You can listen to it here by clicking on the link --> [You should really just use the sidebar and find your way through](https://thedarklynx786.github.io/bpbx-jmbx-tracks/elementalsost/)

Once again, this soundtrack utilizes my signature scale, the Cm phyrgian scale. This time around however, I played around with volume control and and a bunch of other tools that I was somewhat unfamiliar with before, and I happened to get significantly richer sounds. A friend even wanted to sample "Bloodlust," one of the tracks I made for this soundtrack. This composition was a big success, and I learned a whole lot about EQ filters and many different tools!
