## About Me
I'm Murtaza Haque, and I'm a fervid programmer who loves to code stuff! I also do many other things that people refer to as 'hobbies.' Combining these interests together, I made this website as an online warehouse or diary for all of the activities I undertake. You can expect to find many of my projects here as well as my personally curated blogs on some things that I like talking about.

## So what can you expect to find on this website?
* Biking Tales
* MATH, OHH LOTS OF MATH
* Me performing music
* Some of my own music
* Other programming projects
* Occassional meme or two?
* Website updates (no brainer)
* Deep philosophical questions nobody asked for

...And more! I'll see what I can add to this website now and then. I might even embed some games on this site.
