Welcome to the music section of my website! I have been involved with music since the start of 2018 and I'm still running strong! I primarily play percussive instruments, though I have some knowledge of guitar and a little in piano. Here you can find covers that I've made or pieces that I have performed (Yet to be added).

I also compose electronic music using an online DAW I found called [**BeepBox**](https://www.beepbox.co/) (developed by John Nesky) and a mod for BeepBox called [**JummBox**](https://jummb.us/). I don't really have FLStudio or any other professional DAWs, so this will have to work for now. It is really simple to learn and you can make some awesome tracks with it! Below showcase some of the tracks I have made.

If you would like to remix some of my tracks, you are welcome to use the download buttons to import the JSONs into BeepBox/JummBox! Feel free to play around and make your own versions, edits, or fixes to the track, but please give credit if you are willing to share!
