Welcome to the music section of my website! I have been involved with music since the start of 2018 and I'm still running strong! I primarily play percussive instruments, though I have some knowledge of guitar and a little in piano. Here you can find covers that I've made or pieces that I have performed (THIS PART IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION).

I also compose electronic music using an online DAW I found called [**BeepBox**](https://www.beepbox.co/) (developed by John Nesky) and a mod for BeepBox called [**JummBox**](https://jummb.us/). I don't really have FLStudio or any other professional DAWs, so this will have to work for now. It is really simple to learn and you can make some awesome tracks with it! Below showcase some of the tracks I have made.
