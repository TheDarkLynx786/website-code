"Four Horsemen" is the album I created where I wanted to play around with creating metal tracks on JummBox. Due to its very MIDI nature, JummBox only has one guitar feature for a distinctly "metal" sound. I wanted to try and play around with the tools in JummBox and transform this guitar sound into something more than just its preset. 

The idea for the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse was kind of random, it just popped into my head. I did think it would make for a really sick theme for a series of metal tracks, and so I decided to center this album from the perspective of the four horsemen. 

Once again, this uses the Cm/Gm phrygian notes, the ones that produce a really sick metal sound. I have also used certain riffs and musical themes from many different inspirations, ranging from Slipknot to MASTER BOOT RECORD, though they may not be apparently obvious. Check out each track descriptions for more details.
