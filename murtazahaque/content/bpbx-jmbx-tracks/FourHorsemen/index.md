-   title: War
    description: "This track kind of picks off what I put down for Bloodlust, another track I've made that you can check out on this site. I wanted to go full-blown metal for this, but the distortion probably got the best of the track. It took over 7 iterations to get it to a point where it sounded alright, but considering how the newer tracks like Famine turned out, I might revisit it once more to boost the volume and rid the distortion. I happened to have also used a small Cm phyrgian riff from the start of \"Pyschosocial\" by Slipknot. This is also where I began to play around with panning effects, and I had a lot of fun using them!"

-   title: Pestilence
    description: "This track is slower and more movement based. It starts of slow and is supposed to \"sound\" like disease. Then, it jumps into a metal structure and enters a solid groove towards the middle. Not one of the most exciting tracks, but I still think it turned out quite nice. I happened to use some progressive or \"djent\" sounding parts of the track from a song callled \"Through Purgatory\" by a very niche band called \"City of Dis.\" The ending guitar effects were kind of an accidental discovery, but ended up adding a great finish to the track."

-   title: Famine
    description: "This track had some things change in it compared to the previous ones. I utilized pan effects and layered 2 different guitars to create a louder, richer guitar sound without any of the distortion that comes with the lower octaves. Then, I simply took advantage of the pan effects to create really cool effects and countermelodies within the track, especially around 30 seconds into the track. Overall, the piece was a whole lot of fun and I really enjoyed trying to perfect this style. A small part of this track is inspired by a track from MASTER BOOT RECORD called \"DBLSPACE.EXE.\" I just shifted a particular section into a different key signature and made it match the tempo of the track."

-   title: Death
    description: "Applying the principles from Famine, this track has the same effects, except this time the backing drone sound that Famine had is replaced by the sound of a church bell (\"tubular bell\"). This portrays that sound of \"Death.\" I even decided that this piece should feature some sort of calm middle section, which I thought to be quite fitting for this piece. Some inspiration for this piece comes from \"Questions\" by British thrash metal band Xentrix, as I got the idea of using the ending section from that song."

"Four Horsemen" is an album I created to play around with composing metal tracks on JummBox. Due to its very MIDI nature, JummBox only has one or two guitar features that produce a distinctly "metal" sound. I played around with some of the tools in JummBox and managed to transform these guitar sounds into something more than just its preset's "MIDI metal" sound. 

The inspiration for this album certainly came from the biblical tale from the Book of Revelation (as a disclaimer, I'm not Christian). I thought it would make a sick metal theme as it concerns the end of the world, and some tinkering resulted in these 4 tracks, one for each horseman.

Once again, these tracks use notes from the Cm phyrgian and Gm phyrgian scales, the ones that produce a really dark and cool metal sound. I have also used certain riffs and musical themes from many different inspirations, ranging from Slipknot to MASTER BOOT RECORD, though they may not be apparently obvious. Check out each of the track descriptions for more details.
