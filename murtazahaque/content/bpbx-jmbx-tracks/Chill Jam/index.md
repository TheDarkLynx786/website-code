This track was inspired by those weird but good sounding ethereal-aesthetic drones that you sometimes find on YouTube, and also a little bit by the OneShot OST. I also kind of wanted to encapsulate the feeling of stying nice and warm inside while it snows outside, which is certainly wishful thinking because there was no snow when I was creating this piece.
