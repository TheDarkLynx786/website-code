tracks:
-   title: C-Minor Beep Box
    description: This was my second ever work with BeepBox. I wanted to play around with my favorite music scale, C minor (C minor IS my favorite key signature, how could you tell?). Just something very basic with a chorus, a mid-section, and a fade out.

-   title: BeepBox Bop 1
    description: The very first of many! This was my first BeepBox track after a friend introduced me to the software, something he used to create 8-bit-style music for his games. This track was made for a game jam, where my friends and I got together to create a mouse-only scroller game. It was supposed to be fairly fast-paced, so I made this loopable 7-second fast paced track. Very rudimentary, but it should have worked for the game jam, if we finished that game.

-   title: Such Shop
    description: "This one is almost a joke one: I kind of made it by accident while working on another project. It's supposed to be a small shop theme from any generic RPG maker game like Undertale, though now that I look back it seems I have added far too much drums. Typical percussionist, I know."

The tracks showcased here are a bunch of play-around tracks I made before I got the ropes of making music on BeepBox/JummBox. They are pretty basic and a good place to look back to see how far I've come.
