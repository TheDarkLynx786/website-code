I made this piece after playing around with some chords on a piano site (link on the main page). The progression was assisted by a really cool melody and a great sounding preset, and soon it evolved into this track. I also made a fun little music-box section, and added a violin solo at the end.

This is also the first track I made that was non-loopable and a full piece.
