This soundtrack was one I created while working in HackClub's Arcade Summer Hackathon. I collaborated with a bunch of people to create a Roblox game, where I was the sound designer and track composer. I had a lot of fun, and I ended up creating one of my favorite tracks (the lobby theme).

Once again, it really never gets old: I keep using notes that revolve around G and Cm. When they work together, they efficiently create a metal or rock atmosphere, hence why Cm is my favorite key signature and why the notes that it plays around with are often used in metal.

Arcade required you to have a Github commit for each project you upload, so (the only time I'm ever going to do this), here is the [Github Repo](https://github.com/TheDarkLynx786/Elementals-OST) for all the tracks and SFX I have designed for the project. You can also get access to the JSON files, so you can remix and play around with what I made (Note to self, make this a feature for all the tracks!).
