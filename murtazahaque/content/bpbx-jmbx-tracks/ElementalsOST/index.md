tracks:
-   title: Deadly Current
    description: This was kind of the "main battle theme" or a boss theme in the game. I also started playing around with the instrument volume sliders to reduce muffling sounds, and frankly it turned out great! My newer themes seem to have a higher quality to them, at least that's what it feels like. Could just be the work of EQ filters.

-   title: Lobby Theme
    description: This would be the theme that plays in the lobby. I went for something a little heavy to remind the player that indeed, this is a gun game, but made it sound ethereal towards the middle to remind the player that these guns use magic. I think the mix came out really nice because I learned how to control the instruments volume sliders, and not let it break the DAW's limiter to make it sound muffled.

-   title: Shop Theme
    description: This is supposed to be the shop theme. It may kind of sound serious compared to shop themes from other games, but I kind of wanted to remind the player once again that this is a gun game and you are buying guns. In that sense, the track tries plays heavy music for that cool feeling.

This soundtrack was one I created while working in HackClub's Arcade Summer Hackathon. I collaborated with a bunch of people to create a Roblox game, where I was the sound designer and track composer. I had a lot of fun, and I ended up creating one of my favorite tracks (the lobby theme).

The game was previously called SparkOps with the idea in mind that we can shoot electricity out of our guns as a game mechanic, but then we settled on using all the elements through runes and renamed the game Elementals.

Once again, it really never gets old: I keep using notes that revolve around G and Cm. When they work together, they efficiently create a metal or rock atmosphere, hence why Cm is my favorite key signature and why the notes that it plays around with are often used in metal.

Arcade required you to have a Github commit for each project you upload, so (the only time I'm ever going to do this), here is the [Github Repo](https://github.com/TheDarkLynx786/Elementals-OST) for all the tracks and SFX I have designed for the project. You can also get access to the JSON files, so you can remix and play around with what I made (Note to self, make this a feature for all the tracks!).
