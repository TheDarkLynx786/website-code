    description: I was randomly placing notes into BeepBox when I realized that G, A flat, and F made a cool background track. I expanded upon this and soon cooked up a very crude version of the song you hear on this site now. I recently improved it to feature a cool breakdown section and smoother balancing and sound quality through the tools of JummBox.

This is kind of my first "set" of tracks; calling it an album would seem wrong, so I'm deciding it to call it a "suite." It started with the first track, "Corporate Crusade," which was originally made for a game jam with 2 other friends of mine. Eventually I started working on the other tracks, and I soon wish to turn this into an OST for the actual game, which I will be trying to revive, develop, and finish into a decent top-down shooter. I don't have much art to show because art is the one thing I'm lacking in game design, so I'll keep a pixel art of the player sprite as a placeholder image for now.
