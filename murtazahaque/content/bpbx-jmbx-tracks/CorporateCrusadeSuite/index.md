tracks:
-   title: Corporate Crusade
    description: I was randomly placing notes into BeepBox when I realized that G, A flat, and F made a cool background track. I expanded upon this and soon cooked up a very crude version of the song you hear on this site now. I recently improved it to feature a cool breakdown section and smoother balancing and sound quality through the tools of JummBox.

-   title: Placed On Hold
    description: This track started as the continuation to the Corporate Crusade series. I based this off of the original planned style for the game, and eventually I'm going to work backwards to implement it based off of these tracks. This track features a monotone "hold" tone that plays in the back, but then experiences variation in the last breakdown section as a final send-off. Compared to the others, it could use a bit more equalizing, but I think it is fine for now.

-   title: Dial Disruption
    description: I centered this track around a fast tempo and the sound of a telephone. When the fast-paced high-hats kick in, you know that this track is going to feature something with intense or something with a rush. The track features some metric modulation at times, like the rest of the tracks in their breakdown sections, and one transition in their was slightly inspired by "Unstoppable Force" from the ULTRAKILL OST. I want to eventually purpose this track for an action sequence or possibly a boss.

This is kind of my first "set" of tracks; calling it an album seems kinda wrong, so I'm deciding it to call it a "suite." It started with the first track, "Corporate Crusade," which was originally made for a game jam with 2 other friends of mine. Eventually I started working on the other tracks, and I soon wish to turn this into an OST for the actual game, which I will be trying to revive, develop, and finish into a decent top-down shooter. I don't have much art to show because art is the one thing I'm lacking in game design, so I'll keep a pixel art of the player sprite as a placeholder image for now. As I think of more level ideas, I will compose more tracks and maybe update these old ones. 

All of these tracks use the key of C minor, and are centered primarly around the notes G, Ab, and F. Different variations give each track its own identity. I would say this is kind of similar to the Prelude tracks in ULTRAKILL, so there's my inspiration.
